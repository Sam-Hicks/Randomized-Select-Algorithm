# Randomized-Select-Algorithm
The Randomized Select Algorithm is a sorting algorithm that is used to find the ith ordered statistics (ith smallest element) of array A. This algorithm is used to solve the selection problem which seeks to find the ith ordered statistic in a set A of n distinct numbers, where 1&lt;= i &lt;=n.
